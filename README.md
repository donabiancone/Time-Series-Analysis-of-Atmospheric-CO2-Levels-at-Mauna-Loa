# Time Series Analysis of Atmospheric CO2 Levels at Mauna Loa

The objective of this analysis and modelling is to review time series theory and experiment with R packages.

We will be following an ARIMA modeling procedure of the Mauna Loa CO2 dataset as follows:

1. Perform exploratory data analysis
2. Decomposition of data
3. Test the stationarity
4. Fit a model used an automated algorithm
5. Calculate forecasts

The analysis' results are published on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/donabiancone/mauna-loa-tsa).
